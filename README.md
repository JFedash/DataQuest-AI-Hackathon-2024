# DataQuest-AI-Hackathon-2024
Machine learning model to detect fraudulent banking transactions, developed in a high-pressure 3-day hackathon using real-world data. Built with Python and random forest classification.

## Overview

The goal was to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate using a structured dataset. We used features such as transaction amount, location, and time to train a machine learning model that could generalize to an unseen test set.

## Approach

Our team implemented a random forest classifier in Python. I led the machine learning pipeline, handling data preprocessing, model selection, training, and tuning. We followed a rapid prototyping workflow to iterate quickly and improve results under time pressure.

## Outcome

Our final model correctly identified around 75% of fraudulent transactions. While we didnâ€™t win, the project gave us hands-on experience with machine learning, teamwork, and building under constraints.

## Tools

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
